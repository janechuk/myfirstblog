I have 4 brothers who are software engineers but never really though software technology was something I had the capacity to understand. After much though, I decided to give it a shot.
After a few html/css/JS tutorials, and I cant help but say I'm amazed at my deep interest and passion for web dev and I really want to learn more about web development, particularly front end development.
